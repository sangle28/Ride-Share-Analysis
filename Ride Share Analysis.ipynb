    " **Overall Summary of the Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dear Sang Le,\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing your data analysis project for Zuber! Your notebook is well-organized and provides a comprehensive analysis of taxi ride patterns in Chicago. You've effectively structured your project with clear sections, detailed explanations, and appropriate visualizations. Your work demonstrates a solid understanding of data manipulation, visualization, and statistical hypothesis testing.\n",

    "<div style=\"border-left: 7px solid green; padding: 10px;\">\n",
    "<b>✅ Strengths:</b>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li><b>Data Loading and Preparation:</b> You efficiently loaded the datasets and performed necessary data cleaning, including converting data types and checking for duplicates. Your attention to detail in data preprocessing is commendable.</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>Exploratory Data Analysis:</b> You conducted thorough EDA by identifying the top neighborhoods and taxi companies. Your visualizations effectively highlight key insights, such as the most popular drop-off locations and the taxi companies with the highest trip counts.</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>Visualization Skills:</b> Your use of Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations is effective. The bar charts clearly display the distribution of trips, and the boxplot provides a good overview of ride durations across weather conditions.</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>Hypothesis Testing:</b> You correctly formulated the null and alternative hypotheses and applied the two-sample t-test appropriately to compare ride durations between rainy and non-rainy Saturdays.</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>Interpretation of Results:</b> You provided a clear interpretation of your statistical test results, explaining the implications for Zuber's operations.</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>Overall Presentation:</b> Your code is structured logically, and your markdown explanations guide the reader through each step of your analysis effectively.</li>\n",

    "  <li><b>Formatting and Consistency:</b> Ensuring consistent formatting throughout your notebook, such as uniform use of headings and consistent spacing, can enhance the overall presentation of your work.</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>Additional Insights:</b> While your interpretations are insightful, including more detailed recommendations based on your findings could further strengthen your conclusions. For example, suggesting specific strategies Zuber could implement to address longer ride durations on rainy Saturdays.</li>\n",

    "\n",
    "Your project is thorough and well-executed, demonstrating strong analytical skills and attention to detail. You have effectively addressed the critical issue from the previous review by correctly applying the two-sample t-test and providing a detailed interpretation of your findings. Your analysis provides valuable insights that can help Zuber make informed business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great job! Your project meets all the requirements, and we are happy to approve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhance Recommendations:**\n",
    "  - Based on your findings, provide more specific recommendations for Zuber. For instance, suggest increasing the number of drivers on rainy Saturdays or implementing strategies to reduce ride durations during bad weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improve Formatting Consistency:**\n",
    "  - Ensure uniform use of heading levels and consistent spacing between sections to enhance the professional appearance of your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explore Additional Analyses:**\n",
    "  - Consider exploring other factors that might influence ride durations, such as time of day or specific locations within the top neighborhoods, to provide a more comprehensive analysis.\n",
